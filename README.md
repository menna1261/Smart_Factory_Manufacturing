A smart factory project where products move through various manufacturing steps on the factory floor.
The space efficient LinkedList represents the sequence of steps each product undergoes,
Each node in the LinkedList contains information about a particular manufacturing operation,
While the "Queue" manages the order in which products enter these operations.
